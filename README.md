# Logistic-Regression
1. I have a dataset from databricks that gives me a research from many users classifying their lifestyles, based on four features:bmi,vo2,resting_heartrate,active_heartrate
1. So, this code is to use the Logistic Regression Algorithm to create a model to classify the lifestyle of the users.
